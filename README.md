# **Fire Out!**

A retro, 1-Bit shooter made in Unity. The game was kind of a "clone" attemp of the game [The Lesser Evil](https://jontopielski.itch.io/the-lesser-evil) by [Jon Topielski](https://jontopielski.itch.io/). All of **Fire Out!** game assets were made by me in Aseprite, including the sprites and animations.

## **The Game**

You are a firefighter. Your job is to defeat the Fire Devil using your trusty hose. Squirt water to put out those little devils!

Fight your way through 10 nights, each gets progressively harder than the one before with the **curse system**. Seal your fate, and may luck be with you on the journey of defeating the Fire Devil!

## **How To Play**

Move your character with **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** or using the **arrow keys**.

Shoot your trusty water hose with **left mouse button**. Be mindful of your water reserve though!
Kill enough enemy each night to move on to the next!

After each night, the game will introduce 2 new curses for you to choose from. Be wise!

### _Disclaimer_

This was my very first completed game in Unity, so don't expect clean code and structure. I tried to keep them as clean as I could, but hey I'm learning! The game uses C#'s event system for its events, with a game manager and event manager. Oh and I just throw the whole Unity project here so whoops ಥ_ಥ
